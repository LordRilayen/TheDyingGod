Now there are seven above you, and four more below.\n\nTwo steps down, you cross with the first, turning his blow up into the air, followed by a quick kick in the chin. The man stumbles away, falling sideways off the stairs. You bring your sword down on the next, but he catches it and turns it aside with a parry of his own. \n\nThen you feel a sharp pain across your back. A hand is on your shoulder, almost comforting, but you know what it means even before you see the point of the blade.\n\n[[Restart|Start]]</div><div tiddler="The smithy 2" tags="" created="201504261722" modifier="twee" twine-position="2203,4647">From inside the smithy, you can see another building across the street, and from there you could get around the front gates of the keep. There may be a way through the walls there. You can also see the front gate, and there isn't much more distance to cover to get there, either.\n\n[[Go around|Around the keep]]\n[[Rush the front gate|Inside the gates]]</div><div tiddler="A table and an axe" tags="" created="201504261641" modifier="twee" twine-position="1826,4263">You duck down as the man spins around and rips the axe from the table, but you aren't quite quick enough. He overturns the table on you, knocking you to the ground, and is on you immediately. A drawn axe is faster than a sheathed sword, and you don't last long on the floor.\n\n[[Restart|Start]]</div><div tiddler="Infernal Keep Courtyard" tags="" created="201504210032" modifier="twee" twine-position="128,2378">When you say your name, the guard on the other side turns quickly to the gatehouse and shouts, &quot;Hey! He's here, open the gate!&quot; He turns to you and says, &quot;Get in here, something's wrong.&quot; The gate opens, and the guard grabs you by the arm and pulls you roughly into the courtyard before you can hardly process the situation.\n\nThe courtyard is rectangular, but angled so that the gate cuts off a corner of the walls and the stairs stick out into the center of the yard. On the first landing, surrounding the great dragon statue in the center, the entire garrison of the Infernal Keep is standing around waiting for something. They all are looking expectantly towards the doors, shut tight, with the commander of the garrison pacing back and forth along the upper level.\n\nWhen the men hear the sound of the gate crash closed behind you, a few of them turn towards you. As soon as you are recognized, and your presence announced through the ranks, the men turn around as one, watching you now instead of their commander.\n\nTo a man, they are terrified.\n\nThe commander, when he notices, stops pacing and descends the stairs.\n\n[[Meet him at the statue.|By the Statue]]</div><div tiddler="Outer Arc West by the Pond" tags="" created="201504201522" modifier="twee" twine-position="697,1338">You stand at the northern edge of a large pond. Across the water you can see a massive statue of a dragon, along with a pile of rubble around the remains of a stone man, shattered at the ankles. The remains on the ground are so old they no longer have form. This is one of many such places in the city, and one of the few spots in this district which could be considered safe.\n\nTo the south, the road rises slightly to cross another, running east to west. Far beyond, the buildings slowly turn to stone, but you are still not in a safe place, and have a ways to go before you are.\n\nTo the east, Outer Arc Lane crosses a street running north to south without a name. That way descends deeper into this rough part of town, and from here it is hard to see the end.\n\n[[Go south|Central Arc West 2]]</div><div tiddler="The Man's Name" tags="" created="201503021922" modifier="twee" twine-position="816,89">&lt;&lt;if $rough is 1&gt;&gt;The man sighs. &quot;Deqin,&quot; he says smugly. &quot;The Jester.&quot; He grins evilly.\n&lt;&lt;set $knowsDeqinsName = 1&gt;&gt;\n[[&quot;Why did you kill my boy?&quot;|An Answer][$legInjured = 1]]\n[[(Throw him against the wall.) &quot;Why did you kill my boy?&quot;|An Answer][$rough = 2]]\n&lt;&lt;else if $rough is 2&gt;&gt;&quot;If you're who I think you are, I suppose that makes me the one who did for your boy.&quot;\n\n[[&quot;Why?&quot;|An Answer]]\n[[(Punch him across the face.) &quot;Do not test me.&quot;|An Answer][$rough = 3][$deqinDead = 1]]\n&lt;&lt;else if $rough is 3&gt;&gt;&quot;You seem quite certain who I am, don't you?

To the north, the road descends a slight slope until it crosses the Central Arc.\nTo the west, the road dead ends at a cross street from the Central Arc up to the King's Road. The road continues to the east, crossing a nameless side street before arcing down into Market Square in front of the Infernal Keep. To the south, the road climbs a large, steep hill, and the King's Road is at the top.\n\n[[Go north|Central Arc West 2]]\n[[Go west|Inner Arc West 2]]\n[[Go south|King's Road West 1]]\n[[Go east|Inner Arc Center]]</div><div tiddler="Inner Arc West 2" tags="" created="201504201952" modifier="twee" twine-position="408,1940">You stand at the western end of Inner Arc lane.

When they open again, they are distant and buried in memory, looking at a time and place far different from the one you stand in now.\n\n&quot;The Dragonkin, Bael,&quot; he says. &quot;His place was by the side of the Infernal King. That such a man should exist, a man to sit on this throne, is a truth older than memory. Do not fear that you should not have heard of him, for no man has in a thousand thousands of years. Bael was to stand at his right hand, and at mine, from the First King, and every one after him. A friend, and a servant, and a strong right hand, for all of time.&quot;\n\nThe Infernal Lord raises his wing from the throne and plants the claws of both wings on the ground. Using them almost like crutches, he pushes himself up onto his feet, and you see how truly massive he really is. He steps around the throne and climbs down off the dais to your level, forcing you to take a few steps back to give him room.\n\n[[Next|Why Your Son]]</div><div tiddler="Blades" tags="" created="201504202048" modifier="twee" twine-position="13,1179">You open your mouth to speak, but before you can say a word, both men draw their swords.\n\n[[Draw your blade|A Dance in the Rain]]</div><div tiddler="second building" tags="" created="201504261611" modifier="twee" twine-position="1903,4747">You hop through a window out into the alleyway and, still hidden between the walls, climb through into the next building.\n\nImmediately, you realize you are far more exposed than you would like to be, especially considering you are less than a hundred yards from the gate to the keep.\n\nAcross the street, you can see another building, this one substantially more whole. There is a man inside, with an axe stuck in the table beside him, but his back is to you.\n\n[[Sprint for the gate|Inside the gates]]\n[[Cross the street|third building]]</div><div tiddler="Vaemor" tags="" created="201504210737" modifier="twee" twine-position="918,4825">You come upon the city of Vaemor at dusk. You are in a stand of trees quite some distance from the city walls, but even from here you can tell that they are unmanned. Vaemor is a proper city, not some run down fortress, and there is simply too much wall for a plague of bandits to cover, even with so much of it broken and unusable.\n\nYou can either walk straight through the south gate, or try and find a breach in the walls to sneak through.\n\n[[Enter the gate|Southern Vaemor]]\n[[Find a breach|Southern Vaemor Stealth]]</div><div tiddler="Outnumbered 2" tags="" created="201504262329" modifier="twee" twine-position="3062,4553">You draw your sword and march into the courtyard. The first bandit turns as you approach, but you cut him down before he can react. Another reaches you with his sword drawn, and you match him a few blows as a third approaches.\n\nYou open the second man's guard and stab him quickly, turning immediately on the third. As you do so, you realize there are now four more behind him. You trade a few blows with the third, before a fourth is on you, forcing you to guard against him as well.\n\nBy the time the fifth bandit descends, you have already taken three cuts to the chest, and finishing you off is a simple matter.\n\n[[Restart|Start]]</div><div tiddler="Back alley" tags="" created="201504262236" modifier="twee" twine-position="1437,5132">You duck behind the buildings before you're spotted, and quickly move past them. \n\nWhen you reach the last building before the riverside, you look inside and notice that it is a ruined shop. As there is no way around behind it, you hop over the wall and inside.\n\nThere's not much left, but you could always look around for a moment. Otherwise, you can see a ledge down below street level that you could sneak along to approach the keep from the river.\n\n[[Explore|a shield]]\n[[Climb down to the river|The edge of the river]]</div><div tiddler="StoryTitle" tags="" created="201504181731" modifier="twee" twine-position="7,8">The Dying God</div><div tiddler="No one" tags="" created="201503021903" modifier="twee" twine-position="677,89">&lt;&lt;if $rough is 2&gt;&gt;&quot;No one you ought to be trifling with, that's quite certain.&quot;\n\n[[&quot;Answer the question.&quot;|The Man's Name]]\n[[(Hit him against the wall) &quot;Answer the question!&quot;|The Man's Name][$rough = 3]]\n&lt;&lt;else if $rough is 1&gt;&gt;&quot;I think I'll keep that to myself, unfortunately.&quot;\n\n[[&quot;Answer the question.&quot;|The Man's Name]]\n[[(Throw him into the wall.) &quot;I said.

In the middle of the road, there is a massive fountain, carved in the shape of two great dragons, one curled around the other. Water sprays out from their mouths and from the tips of their wings into a pool below, half as large itself as many of the crossroads within the lower city.\n\n&lt;&lt;if $legInjured is 1&gt;&gt;You look through the gates of the Infernal Keep and see that there is a great commotion inside. You are curious, but perhaps marching into the Keep bleeding from a knife in your leg isn't the wisest course of action.\n\n[[Go north|Central Arc and Market Street]]\n[[Go northwest|Inner Arc Center]]\n[[Go west|King's Road West 1]]\n&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\nAbove you, the Infernal Keep stands startlingly black against the night sky. The basalt walls are perfectly smooth, made of massive carven bricks fused together with dragonfire. Constructed in an age thrice forgotten, its imposing and sinister facade belies the relative peace and tranquility of the present day. The Infernal Lord, despite his dark and forbidding title, is a wise and powerful ruler, well-loved and respected to the farthest corners of Calorden.\n\nYou approach the gates, and are questioned by a guard--disconcerting, being one yourself, but not surprising, as your sword is the only piece of your normal gear you currently possess.\n\n&lt;&lt;if $converseWithGuard is 1&gt;&gt;\n[[&quot;It's me, Aethur Khorensson?

She is white, with claws and horns that shine like diamond. The light playing amidst the water reflected off the crystal in the ceiling, shooting rays of brilliance flashing off of her body. Her legs are straight, proud and on display--defensive, but not hostile. Her wings were open wide, as much on display as to hide the smaller dragon behind her, crinkled like old leather and yet also radiant, as though they were made of stained glass.\n\nBehind her, the smaller dragon waits and watches, silently. She is not so magnificent as her mother or father, but you also see something different about her. Something not unlike the Keep, and not unlike the island. Or perhaps, not unlike her father, and the cause of the feeling here on the island. She is not so magnificent as her diamond mother, because she is yet uncut. She is not so regal as her silver father, because she is yet unforged. There is a beauty in her that defys explanation, the beauty of purest potential--you can see it in her eyes, even from this distance.\n\nAnd you feel your son in her curious eyes. So many long weeks since you spoke. Since the last embrace before his departure. Every moment of his life you feel, looking into those eyes. All the memories flood your own eyes, for you are doing the one thing you knew you would never do again--you are looking into the eyes of your son.\n\nThere they stand, the mother and the heir.\n\n[[&quot;My name is Aethur Khorensson.&quot; (Draw your sword and place the point on the ground.) &quot;I bear the Silversteel of the Infernal Lord, and I have come to bring you home.&quot;|Start]]</div><div tiddler="The sewers" tags="" created="201504262302" modifier="twee" twine-position="2316,5014">The sewers underneath the keep, as it turns out, are blessedly simple. A short ways in, you find a dozen branching pathways, but you quickly realize most of them are small dead ends, with large channels in the ceiling rising up into the darkness. The main tunnel, however, is large and mostly straight, though it angles to the north--most likely towards another mouth somewhere on the river's offshoot.\n\nYou follow the tunnel for a while, until finally find a branch with an iron ladder. You can see the moonlight far above.\n\n[[Climb the ladder|The guard in the courtyard 2]]</div><div tiddler="Converse with the guard" tags="" created="201504202226" modifier="twee" twine-position="1878,1313">&quot;They've been asking for you up at the Keep,&quot; says the guard. &quot;I'm not sure why, I just heard it from Crenn, making his rounds, myself.

The guard stands over you, turns the sword around in his hands, and places the tip on your chest. \n\n&quot;Goodnight, sir,&quot; he says smugly, before burying it.\n\n[[Restart|Start]]</div><div tiddler="The waterfall" tags="" created="201504270143" modifier="twee" twine-position="653,5701">The ascent is remarkably easy. There is a strangeness to the island that you can't quite piece, but in a way it is not dissimilar to the Infernal Keep itself.\n\nThe Keep was an intimidating place. The battlements soared, black and terrible, carved of stone so dark it could almost vanish in the night. But inside, it was warm, comforting. And housed a being powerful, ancient, and unfailingly good. The Infernal Lord was, and always had been, a creature of such colossal power that to oppose him was unthinkable, yet none would consider it--or, so you once believed--because it was he who brought peace when men wished for war. Love, when men wished for hate. Life, when men wished for death. Hope, when men wished for despair. This was his purpose, and the Infernal Keep was his place.\n\nThe island has the same feeling. The mountains are enormous, and apparently impassable. Yet, each step you take reveals the next. Though it wears a facade of terrible power, you can feel that this is a place of wondrous beauty.\n\nThis is confirmed as the path takes you around corner, bringing you face to face with a waterfall more beautiful than any you have ever seen.\n\nThe morning sun is flashing this way and that, dancing through the water flowing from the mountaintop, and reflecting off the cliffs around it. Red, yellow, orange, even blues and greens near the edges, a display of color like nothing you've ever seen.

Perhaps he believed it wrong. Perhaps it simply was pride, or perhaps greed. I do not know. Whatever the reason, he struck down my king, and that was when everything shattered.

As he spins around, he turns right into your swing.\n\nThe axe catches him full in the chest, splitting his mail, and drawing out a surprised gasp. Fumbling, he goes for a knife at his belt, but you punch him in the throat and stumbles back and crashes into a chair. One cough, and he is dead.\n\n[[Take the axe|third building no bandit][$hasAxe = 1]]\n[[Leave the axe|third building no bandit]]</div><div tiddler="fight in the street" tags="" created="201504261611" modifier="twee" twine-position="1719,4604">You duck out of your cover and into the road. Immediately, you realize the building across the alleyway was a lot more ruined than you'd first imagined, and you suddenly find yourself completely in view of the keep.\n\nIn your haste to get out of sight again, you stumble directly into a bandit with an axe coming out of the house between you and the smithy. The man is as startled as you are, giving you a moment to assess the situation.\n\nYou are not protected from the archers on the walls where you are currently standing, but there is a large man in ragged chainmail carrying an axe blocking your way.\n\n[[Slash|Shot in the street]]\n[[Thrust|Shot in the street]]\n[[Duck into cover|Fight in the Street 2]]</div><div tiddler="Outnumbered" tags="" created="201504262243" modifier="twee" twine-position="1858,4891">You creep up behind the man, pull out your dagger, and grab him from behind. You cover his mouth with one hand, and slit his throat with the other, pushing dropping him beside the building. It should be easy to get past, now, but you'll have to hurry before any of the others find him.\n\nThe thought has barely crossed your mind before three men step out the door directly in front of you.\n\nThey turn, and immediately one shouts, &quot;'ey! What're you 'ere for!&quot;\n\nThe other two draw their steel when they see the bloody dagger in your hand, and then there are five more rushing out with naked weapons.\n\nYou throw the dagger at one, but he is wearing plate beneath his tunic, and one of the last sounds you hear is the weapon ringing on the mail.\n\n[[Restart|Start]]</div><div tiddler="By the Statue" tags="" created="201504210100" modifier="twee" twine-position="315,2379">You ascend the first level of stairs and circle around the statue, stopping just before your commander reaches the same level. His face is strange...unreadable, almost. He is staring, not looking at anything, most certainly not you. &quot;Aethur,&quot; he says quietly, neither a greeting nor statement. Almost an accusation, but not quite that either.\n\n[[&quot;Commander? What's going on?&quot;|Cold]]</div><div tiddler="Deqin" tags="" created="201504062254" modifier="twee" twine-position="466,3524">The Infernal Lord closes his eyes a moment, and when he opens them again, he is looking neither at nor past you, but somewhere else entirely. \n\n&quot;Deqin,&quot; he says. &quot;The Jester, he is called. A murderer, yet only a pawn of my enemy.&quot;\n\n[[Next|To Arcadia]]</div><div tiddler="Shot in the street" tags="" created="201504261618" modifier="twee" twine-position="1582,4598">You begin to draw your sword, and the other man raises his axe. Before you can attack, however, an arrow in the dark punches into your side.\n\nThe sudden impact drives you to your knees. The man chuckles and swings his axe. You raise your sword to block to blow, but the motion sends a bolt of pain up your side, and he knocks the blade away easily. \n\nYou see the axe fall a second time, and hear it, but the pain doesn't last long at all.\n\n[[Restart|Start]]</div><div tiddler="The Infernal Lord" tags="" created="201503022214" modifier="twee" twine-position="825,489">&lt;&lt;if $rough is 1&gt;&gt;&quot;There are no simple answers, I'm afraid.&quot;\n\n[[&quot;The hard ones, then.&quot;|An Answer][$legInjured = 1]]\n[[(Throw the man against the wall.) &quot;The hard ones, then.&quot;|An Answer][$rough = 2]]\n&lt;&lt;else if $rough is 2&gt;&gt;&quot;The Infernal Lord chose a boy.

A sliver of moon is visible, massive and yellow, over the rooftop of the building directly in front of you, and it is not yet midnight. \n\nTo your right, the alleyway vanishes into darkness. You are close to the walls of the city, and can see them over the tops of the buildings, but from where you stand cannot tell if the alley reaches them.\n\nA short ways to your left, you can see the road.\n\n[[Right|Dead End]]\n[[Left|Outer Arc Lane Center]]</div><div tiddler="The Throne Room" tags="" created="201504062130" modifier="twee" twine-position="195,3280">You reach up and slide your hands beneath the tails from the outside, palms flat against the cold stone and push. The doors do not budge, and so you take a deep breath and push harder. This time, you feel them give ever so slightly. You hunch down slightly, bent at the knees, waist, and elbows, head bowed, teeth gritted, shoulders trembling, every muscle in your arms rippling beneath the skin, and push. Slowly, the door grinds open, scraping against the floor as a wave of warm air--weak, but the first you've felt in the entire castle--leaks out onto your face.\n\nWhen the door is open sufficiently for you to enter, you step through the door into the warmth, breathing heavily.\n\n&quot;Come closer, my friend,&quot; rumbles a voice from the other end of the hall. The voice resounds from the stone, and seems to come from everywhere at once. It is so regal you nearly kneel on instinct, so deep you almost drown.\n\nThe dragon at the end of the hall is not so large as you had imagined, though he is certainly not small. His flesh is like a broken desert, the scales locked together in an infinite web of creases and cracks. The scales themselves are silver, like a wise man's beard, and his claws and horns shine like a bar fresh from the smelter. As you come closer, you see that he is long and sleek, his legs slender but thickly muscled, his neck long, and his head angular. The bones of his wings are swept back behind him, so that at the first bend the right one wraps around the side of the throne, at the second, forward towards you, and at the third, up onto the seat, draping the area is shining leather.\n\n&quot;I am sure that you have many questions, Aethur son of Khoren,&quot; said the Infernal Lord, rising his head from the ground. &quot;But I have much to explain to you, and precious little time to do so.
